            Today, however, shopping has developed into a world of its own. Lots of people see shopping as more than just a necessity. It’s now commonly thought of as a fun activity to do with friends or family.

Even though many people still flock to town centres to shop in person, the rise of online shopping has made commerce easier than ever before. You can now buy almost anything and have it delivered right to your door at the touch of a button. Whilst this is very convenient (particularly if you need something that might be hard to find), lots of people have ethical concerns about modern shopping culture.

For example, lots of products that we buy have been flown far across the world, which isn’t very environmentally friendly. Also, people who produce these products are not always treated fairly or paid properly for their hard work. Finally, some psychologists think that the ways in which people shop today can affect our mental health in the long run.

These concerns mean that lots of people today want to shop in more ethical or sustainable ways. Shopping ethically or sustainably can mean anything from buying Fairtrade or local produce, to supporting independent businesses, to buying second-hand goods.

The debate around the ethics and environmental impact of shopping would make for a great persuasive writing piece.
